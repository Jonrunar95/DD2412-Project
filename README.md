# DD2412-Project

Project in the course Deep Learning, Advanced Course (DD2412)

In this project we reproduced the paper On pixel-wise explanations for non-linear classifier decisions by layer-wise relevance propagation. We extended it by using LRP on the medical imaging dataset CheXpert. We also did a comparison between LRP and Grad-CAM. A report of the project is in the file DD2412_Project_Report.
